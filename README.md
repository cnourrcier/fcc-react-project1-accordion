# Accordion with single/multi selection modes

Part 1 of the freeCodeCamp 25 React Projects for interview.

This project features a dynamic Accordion component built with React. The component allows users to toggle between single and multiple selection modes for displaying accordion items.

Key Features:

- Single Selection Mode: Only one accordion item can be expanded at a time. Selecting a new item collapses the previously opened one.

- Multiple Selection Mode: Multiple accordion items can be expanded simultaneously, providing a more flexible viewing experience.

- Toggle Button: A button allows users to switch between single and multiple selection modes seamlessly.
